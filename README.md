InterviewQuestions
==================

Sample Code for Programmer Interview Questions given to potential candidates.

This library contains the Interfaces that are expected to be implemented by interviewees along with some implementations that weâ€™ve thought up of to serve as a base line for possible ways to solve the puzzles.

Unit tests that test against the Interfaces are provided as a good starting point for evaluating implementations.

Not all solutions presented are optimal, nor are they inclusive of all possibilities.
